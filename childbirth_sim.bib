The mean duration of a singleton preganancy is 40.0 weeks (280 days), which is dated from the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The period from 37.0 weeks (259 days) to 42.0 weeks (294 days) of gestation is regarded as "term". This article focuses on the onset progress, and mechanics of normal labor term. Topics such as preterm labor (labor before 37 weeks), postterm labor (labor after 42 weeks), and abnormal labor and delivery have not been addressed and are discussed in detail elsewhere in this issue.}

        abstract = {Fetal head moulding is a phenomenon which may contribute to satisfactory progress during delivery as it allows the fetal head to accommodate to the geometry of the passage. In contrast, excessive head moulding may result in cranial birth injuries and thus affect the infant shortly or even long after birth. One group of researchers in the past investigated the biomechanics of fetal head moulding from an engineering point of view and limited themselves to a static, linear model of the parietal bones. In this paper, we present a non-linear model of the deformation of a complete fetal skull, when subjected to pressures exerted by the cervix, during the first stage of labour. The design of the model involves four main steps: shape recovery of the fetal skull, the generation of a valid and compatible mesh for finite element analysis (FEA), the specification of a physical model and the analysis of deformation. Results of the analysis show good agreement with those obtained from clinical experiments on the quantitative assessment of fetal head moulding. The model also displays shapes after moulding which have been reported in previous studies and which are generally known in the obstetric and paediatric communities.}

Clinicians and researchers are more likely to help pregnant women understand and perform posturing correctly if they comprehend the theoretical underpinnings of the technique. In maternal posturing, the forces of gravity and buoyancy combine to form a couple that overcomes frictional forces and/or obstructions to allow the fetus to rotate within the uterus to an optimal position or presentation. Integrating an understanding of these physical processes into clinical practice and research according to the recommendations provided here should lead to greater success in correcting malpositions and converting malpresentations.},

@article{Hoyte2008,
abstract = {Objective: The objective of the study was to develop a model of the female pelvic floor to study levator stretch during simulated childbirth. Study Design: Magnetic resonance data from an asymptomatic nulligravida were segmented into pelvic muscles and bones to create a simulation model. Stiffness estimates of lateral and anteroposterior levator attachments were varied to estimate the impact on levator stretch. A 9 cm sphere was passed through the pelvis, along the path of the vagina, simulating childbirth. Levator response was interpreted at 4 positions of the sphere, simulating fetal head descent. The levator was color mapped to display the stretch experienced. Results: A maximum stretch ratio of 3.5 to 1 was seen in the posteriomedial puborectalis. Maximum stretch increased with increasing stiffness of lateral levator attachments. Conclusion: Although preliminary, this work may help explain epidemiologic data regarding the pelvic floor impact of a first delivery. The models and simulation technique need refinement, but they may help study the effect of labor parameters on the pelvic floor. © 2008 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{DejunJing2013,
abstract = {Objectives—To develop an improved model representation of the biomechanics of the levator muscles during the second stage of labor and to use a sensitivity analysis to explore the pathomechanics of levator muscle injury. Methods—A subject-specific finite element model of human pelvic floor and fetal head was developed based on in vivo MRI data of a fetal head and maternal pelvis. An anisotropic visco- hyperelastic constitutive model employed material parameters estimated from biaxial tests on pelvic floor tissues. Boundary conditions reflected both anatomic constraints and the curve of Carus. A short second stage of labor, scaled to 10 minutes, was then simulated using a single expulsive push made in the absence of levator co-contraction. Results—Large levator stresses occured near the levator hiatus reaching 9 MPa at the pubovisceral muscle enthesis. The dominant principal stresses were located at, and aligned with, the edge of the hiatus. Muscle stretch bordering the levator hiatus was inhomogeneous: The average levator was 3.55 with a high of 4.64 at the pubovisceral muscle enthesis. Decreasing perineal body stiffness by 40\%, 50\%, and 60\% led to reductions in the maximum principal stretch ratio at the pubovisceral muscle enthesis of 8\%, 13\%, and 18\%, respectively. Conclusions—The pubovisceral muscle enthesis and the muscle near the perineal body are the regions of greatest strain thereby placing them at highest risk for stretch-related injury. Decreasing perineal body tissue stiffness significantly reduced tissue stress and strain, and therefore injury risk, in those regions.},

abstract = {Pelvic floor dysfunction is a hidden problem with a magnitude unknown to many. Statistics show that one in every ten women will have pelvic floor dysfunction so severe that it will require surgery. Several studies have shown that pelvic floor injuries during a vaginal delivery can be considered a significant factor in the development of urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse. The objective of the present work is to contribute to the clarification of the mechanisms behind pelvic floor disorders related to a vaginal delivery. For this purpose, a numerical simulation based on the finite element method was carried out. The finite element model intends to represent the effects that the passage of a fetal head can induce on the muscles of the pelvic floor, from a mechanical point of view. The model used for the simulation represents the pelvic bones, with the attached pelvic floor muscles and the fetus. In this work, we simulated the movements of the fetus during birth, in vertex position. We simulated the engagement, descent, flexion, internal rotation, and extension of the fetal head. Results for the pelvic floor stretch values obtained during the passage of the fetus head are presented; the deformation field is also shown. The results were obtained using the finite element method and a three-dimensional computer model of the pelvic floor and fetus. The maximum deformation obtained was 0.66 for a vertical displacement of the fetal head of approximately 60 mm.},

abstract = {Objectives: Contribute to the clarification of the mechanisms behind pelvic floor disorders related to a vaginal delivery. Verify the effect of an occipito-posterior malposition of the fetus during delivery on the stretch values when compared to the normal occipito-anterior position. Study design: A numerical simulation based on the Finite Element Method was carried out. The Finite Element Model intends to represent the effects that the passage of a fetal head can induce on the muscles of the pelvic floor, from a mechanical point of view. The model used for the simulation represents the pelvic bones, with the attached pelvic floor muscles and the fetus. In this work the movements of the fetus during birth, in vertex position, with the fetus presenting in an occipito-posterior malposition were simulated. The results obtained were compared with a simulation in which the fetus presents in the normal occipito-anterior position. Results: A maximum stretch value of 1.73 was obtained in the numerical simulation conducted on this work, where the occipito-posterior malposition was simulated. Conclusion: During a vaginal delivery, the levator ani muscle and the pubococcygeus muscle are the muscles that are subjected to the largest values of stretch and strain. These muscles are the ones at greater risk for a stretch related injury. When compared to the normal occipito-anterior position, the occipito-posterior malposition produces substantially higher stretch vales for the pelvic floor muscles, increasing the risk for a stretch related injury. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

@article{Martins2007,
abstract = {This article describes research involving finite element simulations of women's pelvic floor, undertaken in the engineering schools of Lisbon and Oporto, in collaboration with the medical school of Oporto. These studies are motivated by the pelvic floor dysfunctions that lead namely to urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. This research ultimately aims at: (i) contributing to clarify the primary mechanism behind such disorders; (ii) providing tools to simulate the pelvic floor function and the effects of its dysfunctions; (iii) contributing to planning and performing surgeries in a more controlled and reliable way. The finite element meshes of the levator ani are based on a publicly available geometric data set, and use triangular thin shell or special brick elements. Muscle and soft tissues are assumed as (quasi-)incompressible hyperelastic materials. Skeletal muscles are transversely isotropic with a single fiber direction, embedded in an isotropic matrix. The fibers considered in this work may be purely passive, or active with input of neuronal excitation and consideration of the muscle activation process. The first assumption may be adequate to simulate passive deformations of the pelvic muscles and tissues (namely, under the extreme loading conditions of childbirth). The latter may be adequate to model faster contractions that occur in time intervals of the same order as those of muscle activation and deactivation (as in preventing urinary incontinence in coughing or sneezing). Numerical simulations are presented for the active deformation of the levator ani muscle under constant pressure and neural excitation, and for the deformation induced by a vaginal childbirth.},

abstract = {The use of biomechanical modelling, especially in conjunction with finite element analysis, has become common in many areas of medical image analysis and surgical simulation. Clinical employment of such techniques is hindered by conflicting requirements for high fidelity in the modelling approach, and fast solution speeds. We report the development of techniques for high-speed nonlinear finite element analysis for surgical simulation. We use a fully nonlinear total Lagrangian explicit finite element formulation which offers significant computational advantages for soft tissue simulation. However, the key contribution of the work is the presentation of a fast graphics processing unit (GPU) solution scheme for the finite element equations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first GPU implementation of a nonlinear finite element solver. We show that the present explicit finite element scheme is well suited to solution via highly parallel graphics hardware, and that even a midrange GPU allows significant solution speed gains (up to 16.8 x) compared with equivalent CPU implementations. For the models tested the scheme allows real-time solution of models with up to 16,000 tetrahedral elements. The use of GPUs for such purposes offers a cost-effective high-performance alternative to expensive multi-CPU machines, and may have important applications in medical image analysis and surgical simulation.},

@article{Johnsen2014,
abstract = {PURPOSE: NiftySim, an open-source finite element toolkit, has been designed to allow incorporation of high-performance soft tissue simulation capabilities into biomedical applications. The toolkit provides the option of execution on fast graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware, numerous constitutive models and solid-element options, membrane and shell elements, and contact modelling facilities, in a simple to use library.

METHODS: The toolkit is founded on the total Lagrangian explicit dynamics (TLEDs) algorithm, which has been shown to be efficient and accurate for simulation of soft tissues. The base code is written in C[Formula: see text], and GPU execution is achieved using the nVidia CUDA framework. In most cases, interaction with the underlying solvers can be achieved through a single Simulator class, which may be embedded directly in third-party applications such as, surgical guidance systems. Advanced capabilities such as contact modelling and nonlinear constitutive models are also provided, as are more experimental technologies like reduced order modelling. A consistent description of the underlying solution algorithm, its implementation with a focus on GPU execution, and examples of the toolkit's usage in biomedical applications are provided.

RESULTS: Efficient mapping of the TLED algorithm to parallel hardware results in very high computational performance, far exceeding that available in commercial packages.

CONCLUSION: The NiftySim toolkit provides high-performance soft tissue simulation capabilities using GPU technology for biomechanical simulation research applications in medical image computing, surgical simulation, and surgical guidance applications.},

@article{Miller2007,
abstract = {We propose an efficient numerical algorithm for computing deformations of ‘very’ soft tissues (such as the brain, liver, kidney etc.), with applications to real-time surgical simulation. The algorithm is based on the finite element method using the total Lagrangian formulation, where stresses and strains are measured with respect to the original configuration. This choice allows for pre-computing of most spatial derivatives before the commencement of the time-stepping procedure. We used explicit time integration that eliminated the need for iterative equation solving during the time-stepping procedure. The algorithm is capable of handling both geometric and material non-linearities. The total Lagrangian explicit dynamics (TLED) algorithm using eight-noded hexahedral under-integrated elements requires approximately 35\% fewer floating-point operations per element, per time step than the updated Lagrangian explicit algorithm using the same elements. Stability analysis of the algorithm suggests that due to much lower stiffness of very soft tissues than that of typical engineering materials, integration time steps a few orders of magnitude larger than what is typically used in engineering simulations are possible. Numerical examples confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed TLED algorithm. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Accurate results can be obtained only by using appropriate models and solution algorithms. In our previous papers we have presented algorithms and solution methods for performing accurate nonlinear finite element analysis of brain shift (which includes mixed mesh, different non-linear material models, finite deformations and brain-skull contacts) in less than a minute on a personal computer for models having up to 50.000 degrees of freedom. In this paper we present an implementation of our algorithms on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) using the new NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) which leads to more than 20 times increase in the computation speed. This makes possible the use of meshes with more elements, which better represent the geometry, are easier to generate, and provide more accurate results.},
