abstract = {This paper aims to highlight the benefits of simulator training in obstetric manipulations such as forceps blade placement. The BirthSIM simulator is used to mimic operative vaginal deliveries. To characterise forceps blade placement, we studied the curvature of forceps path. The orientation of the forceps blades are studied in the quaternion unit space to ensure time-independent analysis. The results showed progress for all novices in forceps blade placement. Simulator training helps them to develop their self-confidence and acquire experience before working in the delivery room.},
