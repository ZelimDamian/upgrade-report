abstract = {This paper aims to highlight the benefits of simulator training in obstetric manipulations such as forceps blade placement. The BirthSIM simulator is used to mimic operative vaginal deliveries. To characterise forceps blade placement, we studied the curvature of forceps path. The orientation of the forceps blades are studied in the quaternion unit space to ensure time-independent analysis. The results showed progress for all novices in forceps blade placement. Simulator training helps them to develop their self-confidence and acquire experience before working in the delivery room.},

@article{Johnsen2014,
abstract = {PURPOSE: NiftySim, an open-source finite element toolkit, has been designed to allow incorporation of high-performance soft tissue simulation capabilities into biomedical applications. The toolkit provides the option of execution on fast graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware, numerous constitutive models and solid-element options, membrane and shell elements, and contact modelling facilities, in a simple to use library.

METHODS: The toolkit is founded on the total Lagrangian explicit dynamics (TLEDs) algorithm, which has been shown to be efficient and accurate for simulation of soft tissues. The base code is written in C[Formula: see text], and GPU execution is achieved using the nVidia CUDA framework. In most cases, interaction with the underlying solvers can be achieved through a single Simulator class, which may be embedded directly in third-party applications such as, surgical guidance systems. Advanced capabilities such as contact modelling and nonlinear constitutive models are also provided, as are more experimental technologies like reduced order modelling. A consistent description of the underlying solution algorithm, its implementation with a focus on GPU execution, and examples of the toolkit's usage in biomedical applications are provided.

RESULTS: Efficient mapping of the TLED algorithm to parallel hardware results in very high computational performance, far exceeding that available in commercial packages.

CONCLUSION: The NiftySim toolkit provides high-performance soft tissue simulation capabilities using GPU technology for biomechanical simulation research applications in medical image computing, surgical simulation, and surgical guidance applications.},

@article{Miller2007,
abstract = {We propose an efficient numerical algorithm for computing deformations of ‘very’ soft tissues (such as the brain, liver, kidney etc.), with applications to real-time surgical simulation. The algorithm is based on the finite element method using the total Lagrangian formulation, where stresses and strains are measured with respect to the original configuration. This choice allows for pre-computing of most spatial derivatives before the commencement of the time-stepping procedure. We used explicit time integration that eliminated the need for iterative equation solving during the time-stepping procedure. The algorithm is capable of handling both geometric and material non-linearities. The total Lagrangian explicit dynamics (TLED) algorithm using eight-noded hexahedral under-integrated elements requires approximately 35\% fewer floating-point operations per element, per time step than the updated Lagrangian explicit algorithm using the same elements. Stability analysis of the algorithm suggests that due to much lower stiffness of very soft tissues than that of typical engineering materials, integration time steps a few orders of magnitude larger than what is typically used in engineering simulations are possible. Numerical examples confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed TLED algorithm. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
