\section{Introduction to Literature Review}\label{lit-introduction}

The literature review in this report contains an overview of the key literature related to work conducted so far in the Traceability Forensics Project. Specifically this is a brief overview of traceability and requirements traceability (section \ref{lit-traceability}), reverse engineering of source code (section \ref{lit-reverseengineering}) and mining of source code repository data (section \ref{lit-repomining}). Clustering techniques potentially offer the ability to determine semantic relationships and links between software components as an aid to comprehension and so is covered in section \ref{lit-clustering}. Some of these sections are limited in scope for brevity (traceability) or because the topic is a relatively newly investigated part of the project (clustering and to a lesser extent repository mining). 

% Sources used in the review are primarily peer-reviewed academic papers from journals and conferences with some use of widely referenced and used academic books. It is foreseen that a literature review for the PhD thesis will be significantly more detailed in the sections included in this report as well as containing a number of additional topics.

Literature was primarily found through searches of related keywords in Google scholar and DBLP, along with forwards and backwards citation analysis in addition to targeting specific conference proceedings. It is foreseen that the literature review for the PhD thesis will be significantly more detailed within the sections included in this report as well as containing a number of additional topics.
