\section{Introduction to Literature Review}\label{lit-introduction}

The literature review in this report contains an overview of the key literature related to work conducted so far in the area of childbirth simulation.

It is foreseen that the literature review for the PhD thesis will be significantly more detailed within the sections included in this report as well as containing a number of additional topics.
