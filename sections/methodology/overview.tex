\section{Overview}\label{methodology-overview}

This chapter covers the work that has been completed to date. The description of the undertaken tasks will be included along the justification for the particular choise of the approach.

It will start by describing the initial developments on creating a forwards-engineered childbirth simulation. Further steps that have been taken on improving the software system are then described. A brief introduction into finite element analysis is given, with particular focus on Total Lagrangian Explicit Dynamic (TLED) scheme. A CPU based implementation of TLED is outlined and then a parallel GPU based implementation is described. Finally, the initial developments in mechanical contact simulation are presented.
